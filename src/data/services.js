    description: 'Combat hair thinning with PRP hair restoration treatments. Find clinics offering this natural approach to stimulating hair growth and improving hair density.',
    longDescription: 'PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) hair treatment uses concentrated growth factors from your own blood to stimulate dormant hair follicles and promote natural hair growth. A small blood sample is processed to concentrate the platelets, which are then injected into the scalp in areas of thinning. The growth factors stimulate the follicles, extend the hair growth phase, and improve blood supply to the scalp. PRP is effective for early-stage hair loss and thinning, working best for those who still have functioning follicles. Results include reduced hair fall, increased hair density, and improved hair thickness.',

    description: 'Tighten and firm sagging skin without surgery using radiofrequency treatments. Compare clinics offering RF skin tightening for face, neck, and body.',
    longDescription: 'Radiofrequency (RF) skin tightening uses controlled heat energy to stimulate collagen production and tighten loose or sagging skin. The RF energy heats the deeper layers of skin, causing immediate collagen contraction and triggering long-term collagen remodelling. Treatment is comfortable, often described as a warm massage, with no downtime. Results are gradual, improving over 2-6 months as new collagen forms. RF is effective for mild to moderate skin laxity on the face, neck, jawline, and body areas like the abdomen and arms. It\'s an excellent option for those not ready for surgical intervention.',
