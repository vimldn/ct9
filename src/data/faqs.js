        question: 'How much filler will I need?',
        answer: 'This depends on your goals and starting point. A consultation will determine the right amount. Conservative practitioners often recommend starting with less and adding more if desired.'

        answer: 'Yes, strategic placement of cheek filler can provide a lifting effect, reducing the appearance of nasolabial folds and giving an overall more youthful appearance.'

      {
        question: 'Can I combine jawline filler with chin filler?',

      },
      {
        question: 'What are the risks of tear trough filler?',

      },
      {
        question: 'How much downtime is there?',
        answer: 'Downtime depends on peel depth. Superficial peels have minimal downtime (slight redness), while medium peels may cause peeling for 5-7 days.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Are chemical peels safe for dark skin?',
        answer: 'Yes, but careful selection of peel type is essential. Experienced practitioners choose appropriate peels to minimise risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How many treatments will I need?',
        answer: 'A course of 3-6 treatments spaced 2-4 weeks apart is typically recommended for best results, though some improvement is seen after one treatment.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I wear makeup after a peel?',
        answer: 'For superficial peels, makeup can usually be applied after 24 hours. Deeper peels require longer healing before makeup. Your practitioner will advise on aftercare.'

      {
        question: 'What does microneedling treat?',

    ],
    'fat-dissolving': [
      {
        question: 'How do fat dissolving injections work?',
        answer: 'Fat dissolving injections use deoxycholic acid to break down fat cell membranes. The destroyed fat cells are then naturally eliminated by the body over several weeks.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is the fat loss permanent?',
        answer: 'Yes, once fat cells are destroyed, they cannot return. However, maintaining a healthy weight is important as remaining fat cells can still enlarge.'
